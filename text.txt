A wrapper is a class that encapsulates another class, maintaining the same interface as the encapsulated class, or 'wrapee'. This means the wrapper and wrapee share the same public methods and attributes, often achieved using an abstract base class. The wrapper acts as an intermediary, allowing for additional processing before and after calling the wrapee's functions. For example, in an academic context, a 'Procrastinating Student' wrapper class could be created around a 'Student' wrapee class. Both would adhere to a common 'StudentInterface'.
